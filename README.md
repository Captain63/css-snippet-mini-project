CSS Cheatsheet

Webpage developed for GWU Coding Bootcamp project. I leveraged CSS Flexbox and CSS global variables for the first time in this project, allowing me to build a completely responsive webpage that adapts to the viewport of any device without a single media query.

Deployed at https://captain63.github.io/css-snippet-mini-project/

Initial HTML and CSS built in collaboration with Stephanie Davis and Kuba Zhaanbaev and completed by Stephen Roddewig.
